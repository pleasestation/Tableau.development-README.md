## Project Overview
This project includes several Tableau dashboards built to provide insights into various datasets. The dashboards cover a range of analysis types, including:
- **Sales Analysis**
- **Customer Segmentation**
- **Profit Margin Analysis**
- **Incident Management**
- **Revenue and Cost Analysis**
- **Geospatial Visualizations**

Each dashboard is designed with interactive features, filters, and drill-downs to facilitate in-depth analysis.

## Prerequisites
Before running the Tableau files, ensure you have the following installed:
- **Tableau Desktop** (or **Tableau Public** for public users)
- **Excel** (or another tool for opening CSVs)
- Any other dependencies, like Python scripts for preprocessing data (optional)

## Project Structure

### Key Dashboards
1. **Sales Dashboard:** Visualizes monthly sales, profit, and order details across different regions and product categories.
2. **Customer Segmentation:** Uses RFM analysis to segment customers into groups based on their purchasing behavior.
3. **Incident Management Dashboard:** Displays incident frequency, severity, and resolution times across geolocations.

## Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Tableau-Development.git

## Download Tableau Workbooks
Open Tableau and load the `.twb` or `.twbx` files from the `Tableau_Workbooks/` directory.

## Load Datasets
The datasets are provided in the `Data/` folder. You may need to update the file path when loading the data into Tableau.

## Usage
1. Open Tableau Desktop and select **Open** from the file menu.
2. Navigate to the `Tableau_Workbooks/` directory and open the workbook of your choice.
3. Interact with the dashboard using filters, tooltips, and drill-downs to explore the data.
4. If necessary, use the Python scripts to preprocess or clean the data before loading into Tableau.

### Data Preprocessing
If you're using raw datasets, you may need to clean or transform them before loading into Tableau:

### Data Preprocessing
To preprocess the data, navigate to the `Scripts/` directory and run the following command:

```bash
cd Scripts
python data_preprocessing.py
